        I play a lot of different games, below will have a list of my top 3.

        Over my time of gaming I have reached rank 1 on Diablo 3 leader boards multipule times! Witch doctor for the win.

        I also reached Masters in Starcraft 2 before I became a Moba player.
        
         I recently became Diamond in League of Legends as well! (Thats around top 2% which is not to shabby)
