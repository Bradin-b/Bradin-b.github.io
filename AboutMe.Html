    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <div id="myDiv">
        <p>
            I'm 23 and a _freshman_ at <a href="https://missouri.edu/">Mizzou</a> <i>technically</i>. Although I have taken other classes from other colleges so I am more so near a Senior level

            My favorite food is teriyaki chicken, from Kitaros.

            I spend a lot of time on my pc. I do things such as my school work, game with friends, or other things such as coding.

            I have taken several other classes before this is not my first.

            Before this job I had wished to be a pilot.
